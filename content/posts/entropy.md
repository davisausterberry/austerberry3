There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.

This was a fairly humbling week. The COVID-19 virus has officially taken hold of the world. Thus far my professional career has been lacklustre at best. A combination of me being a shitty employee, and office jobs being a poor fit for me has lead me to having 7 jobs in the last 5 years. This isn't something that looks overly good on one's resume. 

Quite frankly, I hate being told what to do. 

The mechanics of a modern day office do not make sense to me. Trading time for money has always seen like a terrible trade. If I can get my work done in 3 hours why cant I just call it a day. Ass in seat time is more important than work output becasue your roll is acting as a good cog in the machine. 

The modern office is built on a complex set of unspoken rules. Office culture and politics are really hard to determine prior to joining the work place. Realistically the only way to get real answers are to find previous employees and ask them what their time was like. The second best is a Glassdoor reviews. When the daliance of the job interview process takes place, both parties are looking for signals to increase their likelyhood for making a good decision. Data points consist of the interview, resume, websites and maybe a lunch if your lucky. 

You are now expected to commit to this decision for no less than 2 years but preferably more. Something where the power dynamic is generaly tilted heavily in favour of the employee. In my most recent workplace, the impact of years of a terrible culture were apparent. Corporate culture was non-existant, turnover daily and there was a complete and utter lack of respect for employees. Signs in the office were held up by paperclips, while the owner drove his Ferarri to work. 

As complaining isn't helpful, I offer the simple advice of don't do what I did. 

Back to entropy, with the distruction of so many lives this week. Where did the energy go? It was all incorrectly transfered to a earlier time. After a 10 year bull market we knew the party was coming to an end, you just never know when. The economic boom bust cycles are inefficient when large businesses are deemed to be too large to fail, and propped up by the government but small business are left to fend for themselves. 

This month, the energy that was used in excess in the past 4 years has asked for it's debt to be repaid. With no clear end of the COVID-19 in sight, I am currious to see what it takes to get the world back on it's feet. I don't think life will be the same after this. I also hope I don't need another job I strongly dislike.
