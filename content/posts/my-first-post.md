Purpose

To assist in the selection of realtor, provide salient facts and strategy for the purpose maximizing returns. 

Realtor Selection

Ensure to use our MLS access to more thoroughly vet realtors in an objective manner. Be aware of being “sold” a listing. Note objective reasons realtor is selected, hold them accountable to these reasons. The MLS will likely provide 100% of the exposure this listing will get. The property will counterintuitively get more attention, thus possibly more value from someone with less listings than more. The only variable is follow-up and service of leads to extract maximum value – not to provide lubricant to get the deal done. Remember, the realtor just wants the deal to close – they do not want to be patient and wait for the highest offer.   There are perverse incentives when selecting a list price. They just want it sold. They also want the listing. So they will either only take the listing at a low price, because they are busy and want a quick sale or they badly want the listing thus will say they can get more than they actually can. Thus, if you are “sold” a listing – do not give them more than a 2-3% price adjustment. Instead, fire-them and offer a small compensation for the professional photos and floor plan.  Musts 

Professional measuring and floor plan and photos. (Cost to realtor ~$500)  Explanation – when you hire someone to measure it, it generally comes back larger than stated in the BC assessment. People will gladly base their costs off of this new number, thus netting a higher sale price. 

Experience with the area – Not needed. Why? All leads will be inbound, there might be some luck meshing with other realtors in their office but anyone can call around other agents and let them know about the property. Most will not do this as realtors are generally lazy and like easy money. 

The most important thing is that they are resourceful and have learnt everything there is to learn about the complex. Strata documents are to be ordered and ready by list date (Everyone will ask, offers will be subject to review) This can be avoided by having them on hand before going live. Generally, takes 5 business days to get, (~$200 extra for the rush). 

Commission – Is always negotiable. It is the reciprocal fee that is super important to keep strong, otherwise “lead foot” can be a problem for cooperating agents.  Rates for the selling agent range from 2.53%-3.5% first 100k/1.15 on balance. Try going for 3% first 100k and 1.1 balance, its fair bit gives you a little more back. For cooperating commission, it is generally a hair lower. In this case it could be made the same as I am proposing a lower commission to start.


Listing strategy

I would look at trying for an aggressive price in the spring market. If no strong offers appear, delist and relist in the fall market at a slightly less aggressive price. Carrying costs on the unit are ~600 a month.
