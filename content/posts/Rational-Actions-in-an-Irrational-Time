A good way to approach anything in life is to only make decisions when you have the data. An imperative initial step is to determine what data is available, itâ€™s reliability, relevance and cost to acquire. Upon doing so, the remaining ambiguity is the price in risk that you will have to pay to take part in the game.

 

At this point it is widely accepted that humans are inherently not rational actors. We allow emotions to impact our decisions as we should. The emotions when relevant are a great way to price in ambiguity.

 

After speaking with some friends that are smarter than I am what (if any) investment actions one should take in a variable and uncertain market, they unanimously agree that the best action is to stick to ones long term plan. If reliable information becomes available, volatility should subside. This is then the time to act, you are no longer catching a falling knife with no floor in site. Resist the urge to buy, just because. You have no clue what you are doing nor what is happening.

What we do know is that humankind is very resilient, there will be brighter days. Many more opportunities to seek an edge, alpha and return a reasonable beta.
