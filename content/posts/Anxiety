Everything can be scary. 

Getting a job. Losing a job. A virus. An expensive mistake.

What differentiates the warriors from the plebs is how you deal with this. You are allowed to have shit days. They happen. Averages don't matter. Avoide walking across a river that is 4' deep on average. It won't go well for you. 

On bad days, you have the chance to be stoic. Calm down and take inventory of your situation and reflect. 

Tomorrow is a new day.
