As the period of globalization and technological advancement proceeds incumbent workers, ie. the youth, face increasingly harder and higher standards of competition.

The follow are the largest factors:

1) Decreased friction - Job postings, university applications, investments and economies have all reduced friction in their processes. Each one of them you can get almost perfect information as to what exists and how you could fit into that picture. The competition pool for jobs has shifted from immediate vicinity that happens to see the posting, to the entire subset of people meeting the basic qualification in the world. This has increased downward pressure on lower level employees as there are so many people willing to work for so little.

2) Perfect Knowledge - Warren Buffett is both good and was looking where others were not. Due to the internet, people are looking everywhere at all times. There are a limited number of assets that cannot be seen or found by the internet. This has mainly been reduced to interpersonal relationships.

3) Technological Efficiency - Many "Jobs" have ceased to exist or are done by computers. Soon there will not be enough high-quality jobs for people. This will prove to be interesting as the deflationary impact of technological efficiency will allow many to focus more on hobbies and the arts, as the former aristocrats enjoyed doing. That said, as the pie is shrinking the game will be more zero-sum than ever.

As such, in order to break the rules of the game - you must first know them. Go learn, break and carve out your niche that can't be easily replaced. Innovate or you will be innovated obsolete.
