Child.
An occurrence for many in life. 
Strollers on walks. Family members. Friends. Babies are around.
Your child, and the time you spend together changes everything. The first cry. The first smile, giggle, even consistent poop. No more is it him and her, us. Its baby J, our priority. A fulltime job for both of us. We are relearning everything around you, while trying to hold onto our relationship and sanity. Her life has changed physically, a year of nurturing. Yours has changed in a very different way. Magical times. Also the most stressful times. I am excited to see the couple that emerges from this year, growing just as fast as baby J.
